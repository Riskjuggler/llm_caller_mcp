# LLM Caller Module - Vision Document

## Executive Summary

The LLM Caller module serves as the centralized AI inference service for our
modular tool ecosystem. By consolidating all Large Language Model interactions
into a single, well-architected service, we achieve operational excellence,
development velocity, and architectural consistency while maintaining the
independence and modularity of our tool design principles.

## Status snapshot (2025-09-27)

- Phase 1 foundation goals are complete and actively maintained.
- Phase 2/3 hardening items (observability polish, pilot integrations) remain
  in progress per the implementation roadmap.
- Later-phase intelligence and advanced features continue to live in the
  strategic backlog pending approvals.

## Vision Statement

**To provide a unified, high-performance, and extensible AI inference layer that
empowers all system modules with consistent, reliable, and cost-effective access
to diverse language models while maintaining operational transparency and
security.**

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Independent & Callable Tool Architecture

- **Service Contract**: Clean, well-defined API that any module can consume
- **Loose Coupling**: Tools depend on the LLM service interface, not
  implementation

- **Composability**: Multiple tools can orchestrate complex AI workflows through
  the service

### 2. Multi-Model & Multi-Provider Support

- **Model Agnostic**: Support for chat, completion, embedding, and specialized
  models

- **Provider Flexibility**: Seamless switching between OpenAI, Anthropic, local
  models, etc.

- **Future-Proof**: Plugin architecture for emerging model types and providers

### 3. Operational Excellence

- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing for all AI
  interactions

- **Reliability**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, and graceful degradation
- **Cost Management**: Usage tracking, rate limiting, and budget controls

## Strategic Objectives

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)

- Unified API for chat completions and embeddings
- Support for 2-3 major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local)
- Basic retry logic and error handling
- Configuration management and API key security

### Phase 2: Production Ready

- Advanced rate limiting and cost controls
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Caching layer for performance optimization
- Streaming support for real-time applications

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer

- Prompt engineering framework and templates
- Automatic model selection based on task requirements
- Fine-tuning integration and model lifecycle management
- Advanced analytics and usage optimization

## Service Interface Design

### Core API Contract

```typescript
interface LLMService {
  // Chat/Completion Interface
  chat(request: ChatRequest): Promise<ChatResponse>
  chatStream(request: ChatRequest): AsyncIterable<ChatChunk>

  // Embedding Interface
  embed(request: EmbedRequest): Promise<EmbedResponse>

  // Batch Operations
  batchChat(requests: ChatRequest[]): Promise<ChatResponse[]>
  batchEmbed(requests: EmbedRequest[]): Promise<EmbedResponse[]>

  // Health & Status
  getHealth(): Promise<HealthStatus>
  getUsage(): Promise<UsageMetrics>
}
```

### Request Configuration

```typescript
interface ChatRequest {
  // Content
  messages: Message[]
  systemPrompt?: string

  // Model Selection
  model?: string
  provider?: string
  taskType?: 'research' | 'query' | 'analysis' | 'creative'

  // Generation Parameters
  temperature?: number
  maxTokens?: number
  topP?: number

  // Operational
  timeout?: number
  retryPolicy?: RetryConfig
  cacheKey?: string
  metadata?: Record<string, any>
}
```

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Model Routing

- **Task-Based Selection**: Automatically choose optimal models for specific use
  cases

- **Cost Optimization**: Route to most cost-effective models that meet quality
  requirements

- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across providers to avoid rate limits
- **Fallback Chains**: Graceful degradation when primary models are unavailable

### 2. Performance Optimization

- **Smart Caching**: Cache responses based on semantic similarity and staleness
  tolerance

- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient HTTP connection management across providers
- **Batch Processing**: Aggregate multiple requests for batch-enabled providers
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time response streaming for interactive
  applications

### 3. Observability & Control

- **Request Tracing**: Full lifecycle tracking from request to response
- **Usage Analytics**: Detailed cost, latency, and quality metrics per tool/user
- **Error Monitoring**: Comprehensive error classification and alerting
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-tool, per-user, and global rate limiting controls

### 4. Security & Compliance

- **Credential Management**: Secure storage and rotation of API keys
- **Data Privacy**: Optional request/response encryption and PII filtering
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable logs for compliance and debugging
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access to different models and capabilities

## Integration Patterns

### Simple Query Pattern

```typescript
// Tool code
const response = await llmService.chat({
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: userQuery }],
  taskType: 'query',
  maxTokens: 500
});
```

### Research Pattern

```typescript
// Tool code
const analysis = await llmService.chat({
  messages: buildResearchContext(documents),
  systemPrompt: 'You are a research analyst...',
  taskType: 'research',
  temperature: 0.1,
  cacheKey: `research:${documentsHash}`
});
```

### Embedding Pipeline Pattern

```typescript
// Tool code
const embeddings = await llmService.batchEmbed({
  texts: documentChunks,
  model: 'text-embedding-3-large',
  metadata: { source: 'knowledge_base' }
});
```

## Technical Implementation Strategy

- **Core Service**: Node.js/TypeScript or Python (FastAPI)
- **API Layer**: REST + WebSocket for streaming
- **Caching**: Redis for response caching
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Configuration**: Environment-based with runtime updates

### Provider Adapter Pattern

```typescript
interface ProviderAdapter {
  name: string
  supportedModels: ModelCapability[]

  chat(request: NormalizedRequest): Promise<NormalizedResponse>
  embed(request: NormalizedRequest): Promise<NormalizedResponse>

  getHealth(): Promise<ProviderHealth>
  getCosts(): CostStructure
}
```

### Configuration Management

```yaml
