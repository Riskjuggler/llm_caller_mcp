# MVP Completion Plan

## Overview

This composite plan consolidates MVP commitments tracked across existing
planning documents. Detailed context for each objective remains in the source
artifacts cited below.

Primary references:

- Core roadmap: `project_docs/planning/LLM_Caller_Implementation_Roadmap.md`
- LMStudio integration: `project_docs/planning/LMStudio_Integration_Plan.md`
- Logging remediation: `project_docs/deepflawss-repair-plan.md`
- Pilot readiness: `README/Pilot_Integration_Checklist.md`
- Backlog guardrails: `project_docs/planning/backlog.md`
- Archived MVP definition: `project_docs/archive/LLM_Caller_Project_Definition.md`

## Delivered MVP Objectives

- **MCP foundation complete** — Phase 1 transport, orchestrator, adapters, and
  tests finalized (see `project_docs/planning/LLM_Caller_Implementation_Roadmap.md:20`).
- **Hardening sprint closed** — Phase 2 telemetry, failure injection, and
  documentation updates approved (see
  `project_docs/planning/LLM_Caller_Implementation_Roadmap.md:58`).
- **Documentation alignment** — Interface schemas, README/runbook, and logging
  guidance refreshed per remediation Workstream A (see
  `project_docs/deepflawss-repair-plan.md:66`).
- **LMStudio discovery & health** — `/mcp/models` endpoint, LMStudio adapter
  discovery, and provider health probes delivered (see
  `project_docs/planning/LMStudio_Integration_Plan.md:24`).

## In-Progress MVP Work

- **Launch readiness tasks** — Phase 3 deliverables such as pilot-specific UAT
  scripting, pilot engagements, and backlog ticketing remain open (see
  `project_docs/planning/LLM_Caller_Implementation_Roadmap.md:91`).
- **LMStudio configuration follow-ups** — Remaining configuration management
  features (model preferences, fallback chains) still pending (see
  `project_docs/planning/LMStudio_Integration_Plan.md:66`).
- **Logging remediation follow-ups** — Workstream D (governance reviews) remains open; testing/guardrails (Workstreams B/C) completed 2025-09-28 (see `project_docs/deepflawss-repair-plan.md:82`).
- **Pilot onboarding preparation** — Checklist items for pre-flight, rehearsal,
  and wrap-up awaiting pilot selection (see
  `README/Pilot_Integration_Checklist.md:16`).
- **Security backlog** — Deferred hardening items (stream chunking, secrets
  rotation, observability exporters, OAuth) remain open (see
  `project_docs/planning/backlog.md:9`).
- **Model routing initiative** — Intelligent routing design approved but not
  yet scheduled (see `project_docs/planning/Model_Capability_Routing_System.md:5`).

## Completion Criteria & Next Steps

1. Finish Phase 3 launch tasks and secure pilot/operations/steering approvals
   (`project_docs/planning/LLM_Caller_Implementation_Roadmap.md:91`).
2. Close remaining LMStudio integration deliverables for discovery, health, and
   configuration (`project_docs/planning/LMStudio_Integration_Plan.md:24`).
3. Close Deepflawss Workstream D (assessor/QA sign-offs) (`project_docs/deepflawss-repair-plan.md:82`).
4. Initiate pilot onboarding and update the checklist with outcomes
   (`README/Pilot_Integration_Checklist.md:16`).
5. Schedule backlog/security and routing items into future phases once MVP
   validation gates pass (`project_docs/planning/backlog.md:9`).

Completion of these steps, combined with the already archived MVP definition
(`project_docs/archive/LLM_Caller_Project_Definition.md:10`), will constitute
final delivery of the MVP scope.
